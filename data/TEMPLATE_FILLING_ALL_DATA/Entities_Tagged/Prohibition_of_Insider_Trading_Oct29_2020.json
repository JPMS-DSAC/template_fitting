He  traded  when  in  possession  of  unpublished  price  sensitiveinformation is what would need to be demonstrated at the outset to bring a charge. Oncethis  is  established,  it  would  be  open  to  the  insider  to  prove  his  innocence  bydemonstrating the circumstances mentioned in the proviso, failing which he would haveviolated the prohibition.(2)In the case of connected persons the onus of establishing, that they were not in possessionof  unpublished  price  sensitive  information,  shall  be  on  such  connected  persons  and  in  othercases, the onus would be on the Board.(3)", "ents": [], "title": null}, {"text": "An  insider  shall  be  entitled  to  formulate  a  trading  plan  and  present  it  to  thecompliance  officer  for  approval  and  public  disclosure  pursuant  to  which  trades  may  be  carriedout on his behalf in accordance with such plan.This  provision  intends  to  give  an  option  to  persons  who  may  be  perpetually  inpossession of unpublished price sensitive information and enabling them to trade in securities ina  compliant  manner.    This  provision  would  enable  the  formulation  of  a  trading  plan  by  aninsider to enable him to plan for trades to be executed in future.  By doing so, the possession ofunpublished price sensitive information when a trade under a  trading plan is actually executedwould  not  prohibit  the  execution  of  such  trades  that  he  had  pre-decided  even  before  theunpublished price sensitive information came into being.(2)Such trading plan shall:\u2013(i)not  entail  commencement  of  trading  on  behalf  of  the  insider  earlier  than  sixmonths from the public disclosure of the plan;It is intended that to get the benefit of a trading plan, a cool-off period ofsix  months  is  necessary.  Such  a  period  is  considered  reasonably  long  for  unpublishedprice  sensitive  information  that  is  in  possession  of  the  insider  when  formulating  thetrading  plan,  to  become  generally  available.    It  is  also  considered  to  be  a  reasonableperiod for a time lag in which new unpublished price sensitive information may come intobeing  without  adversely  affecting  the  trading  plan  formulated  earlier.  In  any  case,  itshould  be  remembered  that  this  is  only  a  statutory  cool-off  period  and would  not  grantimmunity  from  action  if  the  insider  were  to  be  in  possession  of  the  same  unpublishedprice sensitive information both at the time of formulation of the plan and implementationof the same.(ii)not entail trading for the period between the twentieth trading day prior to the lastday of any financial period for which results are required to be announced by the issuer ofthe securities and the second trading day after the disclosure of such financial results;Since the trading plan is envisaged to be an exception to the general ruleprohibiting  trading  by  insiders  when  in  possession  of  unpublished  price  sensitiveinformation, it is important that the trading plan does not entail trading for a reasonableperiod  around  the  declaration  of  financial  results  as  that  would  generate  unpublishedprice sensitive information.(iii)entail trading for a period of not less than twelve months;It is intended that it would be undesirable to have frequent announcementsof  trading  plans  for  short  periods  of  time  rendering  meaningless  the  defence  of  areasonable time gap between the decision to trade and the actual trade.  Hence it is feltthat a reasonable time would be twelve months.(iv)not  entail  overlap  of  any  period  for  which  another  trading  plan  is  already  inexistence;It is intended that it would be undesirable to  have multiple trading plansoperating during the same time period.  Since it would be possible for an insider to timethe  publication  of  the  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  to  make  it  generallyavailable  instead  of  timing  the  trades,  it  is  important  not  to  have  the  ability  to  initiatemore than one plan covering the same time period.(v)set out either the value of trades to be effected or the number of securities to betraded  along  with  the  nature  of  the  trade  and  the  intervals  at,  or  dates  on  which  suchtrades shall be effected; andIt  is  intended  that  while  regulations  should  not  be  too  prescriptive  andrigid  about  what  a  trading  plan  should  entail,  they  should  stipulate  certain  basicparameters  that  a  trading  plan  should  conform  to  and  within  which,  the  plan  may  beformulated with full flexibility.  The nature of the trades entailed in the trading plan i.e.acquisition  or  disposal  should  be  set  out.

For  doing  so,  he  may  need  the  insider  to  declare  that  he  is  not  in  possession  ofunpublished  price  sensitive  information  or  that  he  would  ensure  that  any  unpublished  pricesensitive  information  in  his  possession  becomes  generally  available  before  he  commencesexecuting his trades.  Once satisfied, he may approve the trading plan, which would then have tobe implemented in accordance with these regulations.(4)The  trading  plan  once  approved  shall  be  irrevocable  and  the  insider  shall  mandatorilyhave  to  implement  the  plan,  without  being  entitled  to  either  deviate  from  it  or  to  execute  anytrade in the securities outside the scope of the trading plan.Provided that the implementation of the trading plan shall not be commenced if any unpublishedprice sensitive information in possession of the insider at the time of formulation of the plan hasnot become generally available at the time of the commencement of implementation and in suchevent  the  compliance  officer  shall  confirm  that  the  commencement  ought  to  be  deferred  untilsuch  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  becomes  generally  available  information  so  as  toavoid a violation of sub-regulation (1) of regulation 4.It is intended that since the trading plan is an exception to the general rule that aninsider should not trade when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, changingthe  plan  or  trading  outside  the  same  would  negate  the  intent  behind  the  exception.    Otherinvestors  in  the  market,  too,  would  factor  the  impact  of  the  trading  plan  on  their  own  tradingdecisions  and  in  price  discovery.    Therefore,  it  is  not  fair  or  desirable  to permit  the  insider  todeviate from the trading plan based on which others in the market have assessed their views onthe securities.The  proviso  is  intended  to  address  the  prospect  that  despite  the  six-month  gap  between  theformulation  of  the  trading  plan  and  its  commencement,  the  unpublished  price  sensitiveinformation  in  possession  of  the  insider  is  still  not  generally  available.    In  such  a  situation,commencement of the plan would conflict with the over-riding principle that trades should not beexecuted  when  in  possession  of  such  information.  If  the  very  same  unpublished  price  sensitiveinformation  is  still  in  the  insider\u2019s  possession,  the  commencement  of  execution  of  the  tradingplan ought to be deferred.(5)Upon  approval  of  the  trading  plan,  the  compliance  officer  shall  notify  the  plan  to  thestock exchanges on which the securities are listed.It  is  intended  that  given  the  material  exception  to  the  prohibitory  rule  inregulation 4, a trading plan is required to be publicly disseminated.
